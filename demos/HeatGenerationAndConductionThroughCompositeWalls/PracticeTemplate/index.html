  <!-- I highly recommend looking through the style.css file while you are reading through this HTML. Class attributes E.G. class="class-name" are referenced in the style.css with a period, so .class-name { properties: x; }. ID attributes E.G. id="id-name" are referenced in the style.css file with an octothorpe #, so #id-name { properties: x; }. Generally, you want to use a specific id if there is only one of that element, and class attributes to apply styles to multiple elements. An element can have both an id and classes. You can also have multiple classes delimited via a space E.G. class="class-1 class-2 class-3" or something. But each element can only have one id. There are 3 elements with the class ".input-row", and so we can style all 3 at the same time using the class attribute. The nice thing about the id attribute is that it's easy to access that specific element via JavaScript, using the "getElementById()" function. -->

  <!-- Generally, you want to use wrappers for just about everything because it makes styling things a lot easier. CSS is a bit nuanced and takes some practice, so CSS will probably be your lowest priority. I'll help you out with that, though. -->
