# About
    This simulation is written for LearnChemE and is used for educational and interactive purposes. It is adapted from the Mathematica simulation of the same title by Rachel L. Baumann at http://demonstrations.wolfram.com/StrippingColumnOperation/

# Current TODO
  - Fix second slider issue breaking graph
  - Check if tolerance should be added for stage countoff\
  - Make Graph labels look nicer
