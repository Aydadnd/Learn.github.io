In an ideal solution of multiple volatile liquids, each component follows Raoult's Law, which states that the partial pressure of a single component  ( \( p_{i} \) ) is a function of its pure-component vapor pressure at that temperature ( \( p_{i}^{*} \) ) and its liquid mole fraction ( \( x_{i} \) ):
$$ p_{i} = p_{i}^{*} x_{i} $$
For an ideal gas, the vapor mole fraction is equal to the partial pressure over total pressure:
$$ y_{i} = \frac{p_{i}}{P_{total}} $$
and the sum of the vapor pressures equals the total pressure:
$$ P_{total} = \sum^{n} p_{i} $$
where \( n \) is the total number of components in a mixture. For a binary mixture, \( P_{total} = p_{A} + p_{B} \). Combining the equations above yields a method for calculating vapor composition of component \( i \) for any liquid composition and total pressure:
$$ y_{i} = \frac{ p_{i}^{*} x_{i} }{ P_{total} } $$
In a binary mixture, the phase behavior is often described by the relative volatility of two components:
$$ \alpha_{ij} = \frac{(y_{i}/x_{i})}{(y_{j}/x_{j})} $$
In a binary mixture where \( \alpha_{ij} > 1 \), the vapor mole fraction of component \( i \) will be higher than its liquid mole fraction ( \( y_{i} > x_{i} \) ). Likewise, in a mixture where \( \alpha_{ij} < 1 \), the vapor mole fraction of component \( i \) will be lower than its liquid mole fraction ( \( y_{i} < x_{i} \) ).
