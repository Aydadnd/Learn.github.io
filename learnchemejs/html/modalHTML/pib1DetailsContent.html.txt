The Schr&#246;dinger Equation governing the wave function of a particle takes the general form: 

$$ \hat{H} \Psi = E \Psi $$

where \( \hat{H} \) is the Hamiltonian operator, \( \Psi \) is the wave function, and \( E \) is the total energy of the particle. The one-dimensional time-independent Schr&#246;dinger equation gives a wave function describing the probability density and other properties of a particle at position \( x \):

$$ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2\Psi(x)}{\partial x^2} + U(x) \Psi(x) = E \Psi(x) $$

Above, \( \hbar \) is the reduced Planck constant \( \left(\frac{h}{2 \pi } \right) \), \( x \) is position, \( U \) is the particle's potential energy, and \( m \) is the particle's mass. For a particle confined to an infinite potential energy well of length \( L \), where

\[ 

U(x) = 
    \begin{cases} 
        \infty, & x\lt 0 \\
        0, & 0\leq x \leq L \\
        \infty, & x\gt L 
    \end{cases}
\]

the time-independent solution for the wave function is

\[ 
\psi_{n}(x) = 
    \begin{cases} 
        0, & x\lt 0 \\
        \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L} } \sin ( \frac{n \pi x}{L} ), & 0\leq x \leq L \\
        0, & x\gt L 
    \end{cases}
\]

with \( n \) being any integer such that \( n \geq 1 \). This situation is known colloquially as a "particle in a box". The wave function described above, \( \psi_{n}(x) \), is called an energy eigenstate (or eigenfunction). The complete solution to the time-independent Schr&#246;dinger equation is a linear combination of the possible eigenstates:

$$ \psi(x) = \sum_{n} C_{n} \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L} } \sin ( \frac{n \pi x}{L} ) $$

where \( C_{n} \) is a coefficient relating to the probability one would measure energy state \( n \). Adding time-dependence yields the following equation, with each eigenstate evolving at its own frequency:

$$ \Psi(x, t) = \sum_{n} C_{n} \sqrt{ \frac{2}{L} } \sin ( \frac{n \pi x}{L} ) \exp \left[ -i \frac{n^{2} \pi^{2} \hbar }{2mL^{2}}t \right] $$
